    <p>The Tibetan name for Everest is Qomolangma (ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ, lit. "holy mother"). The name was first recorded with a Chinese transcription on the 1721 Kangxi Atlas during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of Qing China, and then appeared as Tchoumour Lancma on a 1733 map published in Paris by the French geographer D'Anville based on the former map. The Tibetan name is also popularly romanised as Chomolungma and (in Wylie) as Jo-mo-glang-ma.</p>

    <p>Everest Base Camp is another popular viewpoint for Mount Everest, and it offers a unique perspective on the mountain. Located at the foot of the mountain, Everest Base Camp is accessible from the village of Gorak Shep, which is about a 2-hour hike from the town of Lukla. The trek to Everest Base Camp is challenging and requires a good level of fitness and acclimatisation. The trail is long and rocky, and the altitude can make it even more difficult. However, the view from Base Camp is unforgettable. From here, you can see the entire north face of Mount Everest, along with several other peaks in the Himalayas.</p>
